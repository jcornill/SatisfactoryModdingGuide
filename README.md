# Creating a simple satisfactory mod

## Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)

First you need to get SML to be able to start modding satisfactory.
I will explain how to build it in the next chapter for people that already have SML loaded you can skip it.

### Building Satisfactory Mod Loader

SML is still in heavy development and it's better if you learn how to build it from the source file.
First you need to install soemthig to clone the repository on your computer the easiest one is github deskop available [here](https://desktop.github.com/)
After downloading github desktop you need to go on SML github [here](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader)
Here you can choose between Master branch (Stable version) or Development branch (Latest branch but can have bug)
In my example I will use the Development branch
