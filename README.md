# Creating a simple satisfactory mod

## Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)

First you need to get SML to be able to start modding satisfactory.
I will explain how to build it in the next chapter for people that already have SML loaded you can skip it.

### Building Satisfactory Mod Loader

SML is still in heavy development and it's better if you learn how to build it from the source file.

First you need to install something to clone the repository on your computer the easiest one is github deskop available [here](https://desktop.github.com/)

After downloading github desktop you need to go on SML github [here](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader)

Here you can choose between Master branch (Stable version) or Development branch (Latest updated branch but not stable)

In my example I will use the Development branch

Then you can go back on github desktop

You need to go in File > Clone Repository... and select URL tab at the top

On this page paste the link you got from github then choose where you want to place the SML code
